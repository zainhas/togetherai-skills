description: "Real-time and streaming text generation via Together AI's OpenAI-compatible chat/completions API, including multi-turn conversations, tool and function calling, structured JSON outputs, and reasoning models. Reach for it whenever the user wants to build or debug text generation on Together AI, unless they specifically need batch jobs, embeddings, fine-tuning, dedicated endpoints, dedicated containers, or GPU clusters."

# Together Chat Completions

## Overview

Use Together AI's serverless chat/completions API for interactive inference workloads:

- basic text generation
- streaming responses
- multi-turn chat state
- tool and function calling
- structured outputs
- reasoning-capable models

Treat this skill as the default entry point for Together AI text generation unless the task is
clearly offline batch processing, vector retrieval, model training, or infrastructure management.

## When This Skill Wins

- Build a chatbot, assistant, or text-generation endpoint on Together AI
- Add streaming output to a real-time user experience
- Implement tool calling or function-calling loops
- Constrain model output to JSON or a regex-defined shape
- Choose between standard chat models and reasoning models
- Debug request parameters, model behavior, or response shapes

## Hand Off To Another Skill

- Use `together-batch-inference` for large offline runs, backfills, or lower-cost asynchronous jobs
- Use `together-embeddings` for vector search, semantic retrieval, or reranking
- Use `together-fine-tuning` when the user wants to train or adapt a model
- Use `together-dedicated-endpoints` when the user needs always-on single-tenant hosting
- Use `together-dedicated-containers` or `together-gpu-clusters` for custom infrastructure

## Quick Routing

- **Basic chat, streaming, or multi-turn state**
  - Start with [references/api-parameters.md](references/api-parameters.md)
  - Use [scripts/chat_basic.py](scripts/chat_basic.py) or [scripts/chat_basic.ts](scripts/chat_basic.ts)
- **Hybrid reasoning models or empty `message.content` risks**
  - Read [references/reasoning-models.md](references/reasoning-models.md) before writing code
  - If a hybrid model such as `Qwen/Qwen3.5-9B` should return a direct answer in `message.content`,
    especially with `max_tokens` set low, disable reasoning with `reasoning={"enabled": False}`
    unless the user explicitly asked for reasoning output
- **OpenAI SDK migration, rate limits, or debug headers**
  - Read [references/api-parameters.md](references/api-parameters.md)
  - Use [scripts/debug_headers.py](scripts/debug_headers.py) or [scripts/debug_headers.ts](scripts/debug_headers.ts)
- **Parallel async requests**
  - Use [scripts/async_parallel.py](scripts/async_parallel.py)
- **Tool calling or function calling**
  - Read [references/function-calling-patterns.md](references/function-calling-patterns.md)
  - Start from [scripts/tool_call_loop.py](scripts/tool_call_loop.py) or [scripts/tool_call_loop.ts](scripts/tool_call_loop.ts)
- **Structured outputs**
  - Read [references/structured-outputs.md](references/structured-outputs.md)
  - Start from [scripts/structured_outputs.py](scripts/structured_outputs.py) or [scripts/structured_outputs.ts](scripts/structured_outputs.ts)
- **Reasoning models or thinking-mode toggles**
  - Read [references/reasoning-models.md](references/reasoning-models.md)
  - Start from [scripts/reasoning_models.py](scripts/reasoning_models.py) or [scripts/reasoning_models.ts](scripts/reasoning_models.ts)
- **Combining tools + structured output, or tools + streaming**
  - Read the "Combining Tool Calls with Structured Output" section in
    [references/function-calling-patterns.md](references/function-calling-patterns.md)
  - Read the "Streaming Structured Output" section in
    [references/structured-outputs.md](references/structured-outputs.md)
- **Model selection, context length, or pricing-aware choices**
  - Read [references/models.md](references/models.md)

## Workflow

1. Confirm that the workload is interactive serverless inference rather than batch, retrieval, or training.
2. Pick the smallest model that satisfies latency, quality, and context requirements.
3. Decide whether the job needs plain text, tools, structured output, or reasoning.
4. Start from the matching script instead of re-deriving request shapes from scratch.
5. Pull deeper details from the relevant reference file only when needed.

## High-Signal Rules

- Python scripts require the Together v2 SDK (`together>=2.0.0`). If the user is on an older version, they must upgrade first: `uv pip install --upgrade "together>=2.0.0"`.
- Use `client.chat.completions.create()` for Python and `client.chat.completions.create()` for TypeScript.
- Preserve full `messages` history for multi-turn conversations; do not rebuild context from final text only.
- For tools, implement the full loop: model tool call -> execute tool -> append tool result -> second model call.
- Prefer `json_schema` over looser JSON modes when the user needs stable machine-readable output.
- Use reasoning models only when the task benefits from deeper deliberation; otherwise prefer cheaper standard models.
- Some hybrid reasoning models, including Qwen3.5 models, have reasoning on by default. For
  direct-response or low-latency tasks that read `response.choices[0].message.content`, pass
  `reasoning={"enabled": False}` so the answer lands in `content` instead of spending the small
  token budget on reasoning.
- To combine tool calling with structured output, use a two-phase approach: Phase 1 sends `tools` (no `response_format`), Phase 2 sends `response_format` (no `tools`) after tool results are appended.
- Streaming works with `response_format`; accumulate chunks and parse the final concatenated string as JSON.
- If the user needs many independent requests, combine this skill with `async_parallel.py` or hand off to batch inference.
